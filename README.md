# Movie Data Pipeline

This project demonstrates a robust ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) pipeline built using Python for processing movie datasets. It showcases skills in data engineering, Python programming, database management, and data visualization.

## Key Highlights

- Extracts raw movie data from CSV files and cleans it to ensure quality and consistency.
- Transforms data into a structured format suitable for advanced analytics.
- Loads data into a MySQL database using SQLAlchemy, demonstrating backend integration.
- Generates insightful visualizations of movie genres and trends with Python plotting libraries.
- Includes SQL queries for detailed data analysis.

## Technologies & Tools

- Python 3.14, Pandas, SQLAlchemy, PyMySQL
- MySQL as relational database
- Git for version control and GitHub for repository hosting
- Virtual environments and dependency management
